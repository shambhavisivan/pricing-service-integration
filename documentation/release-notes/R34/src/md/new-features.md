## T-54130 Added API for programmatic aggregation module de/registration

Applications that contribute to pricing in overall sales journeys now have a way to programmatically register themselves as sources of partial pricing information.
They will typically do this in post-installation/uninstallation scripts.
For details, see the **Registering a pricing aggregation source** section in the *User Guide*.
